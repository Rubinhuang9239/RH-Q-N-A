## I. What are some best practices for ensuring proper accessibility support?
 
1. Accessibility guidelines should always be considered since the design level.

2. Always keep in mind who is the product’s targeting user, and what disable/hardship will the user to have, for example:
* Cannot use a regular computer input device: what would be the minimum size of fonts, buttons or links.
* Colorblind: are these important buttons/functions are distinguished with colorblind-friendly colors?
* Blind/ Weak visual abilities: Is all UI in the screen implemented with a voice-over friendly method?

3. Use accessibility testing tools.<br/>
Modern browsers like Google Chrome and Mozilla Firefox provide audit tool to perform rating automatically, it is very convenient to rate an existing webpage with these tools.  
Service like aXe, Google ADT, PayPal AATT can also provide accessibility check on a more professional level.

4. User testings.<br/>
Test with real people who have accessibility issues. 
 
 
## II. How do you test to ensure your development work matches the design you are provided?
 
1. Prevent mismatch.<br/>
Provide UX/UI guidelines and build reusable UI components: build once, verify once, prevent to reinvent the wheel, keep change-logs.

2. Use appropriate UI design sharing tools.<br/>
Effective communication between designers and developers plays a key part to build accurate production UI.
Utilize appropriate UI sharing tools is important: Zeplin, Abstract are good choices, they filter out noise that’s not relative to the development and provide tools to annotate dimensions and even provide CSS for the developer to understand the how the UI design been put together.

3. Review/audit with designers on a screen basis.<br/>
The best way to test design is to sit down with the designer who designed the screen, let them use what the developer built and gather what seems not correct. This step prevents any misunderstanding and bias during the development phase.
 
 
## III. What are some best practices for ensuring cross-browser compatibility?
 
CrossBrowserTesting: a very effective way to test responsive implementation, on both desktop/mobile.
 
 
## IV. In your career to-date what are you most proud of?
